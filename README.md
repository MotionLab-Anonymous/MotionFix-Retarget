### Download MotionFix

[MotionFix](https://github.com/atnikos/motionfix) is available from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DM7oIJwxwoljVxAfhfktocTptwVX5sqR).

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥You should rename the motionfix.pth.tar into motionfix_train.pth.tar

### Download SMPL+H and DMPL model

Download SMPL+H mode from [SMPL+H](https://mano.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php) (choose Extended SMPL+H model used in AMASS project) and DMPL model from [DMPL](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/download.php) (choose DMPLs compatible with SMPL). Then place all the models under "./body_model/".

### Extract and Process Data

You need to run the following scripts in order to obtain MotionFix-Retarget dataset:

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥You have specify the output path of data in these ipynb!!!

1. output_files_from_MotionFix.ipynb
2. raw_pose_processing.ipynb
3. motion_representation.ipynb

## Output Results

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥The range of MotionFix data is start from 400000.npy.

The file named in "MXXXXXX.\*" (e.g., 'M400000.npy') is mirrored from file with correspinding name "XXXXXX.\*" (e.g., '400000.npy'). Text files and motion files follow the same naming protocols, meaning texts in "./texts/XXXXXX.txt"(e.g., '400000.txt') exactly describe the human motions in "./new_joints(or new_joint_vecs)/XXXXXX.npy" (e.g., '400000.npy')
